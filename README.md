# The Forage Projects
A compilation of company projects simulating a day-in-the-life experience of a software development at various companies. The work navigates through different project structures and foundational elements like UML and planning docs along with segments of code implementation.

Individual project readme files will explain each project in more detail along with learning objectives and challenges I encountered along the way.

## Project Disclaimer
The workflow of these projects are broken up into tasks.\
Research - Create Solution - Submit - View *correct* example of a solution\
\
My goal in working through these projects is to test my knowledge, research-ability and enhance my learning of real world process flow. There isn't human feedback associated with completed submissions. I've decided in the interest of transparency in my learning process *not* to update my submissions after *correct* examples are given to me at the end of each task. In my opinion, doing so would contradict my goals and engineering work should never be limited to one solution.

With this, all solutions are my own. Unless explicitly stated, AI is not used in any part of the process with these simulations.
